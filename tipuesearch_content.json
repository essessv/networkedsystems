{"pages":[{"text":"I am an engineer interested in all aspects of networked systems - computer networks (incl. software-defined-networks, network virtualization) and distributed systems. Of particular interest is their application in cloud computing and scalable web backend architectures. This blog is an attempt to put my understanding into words, as I try to delve deeper into the internals of these complex networked systems. I have also been a big fan of Werner Vogel's blog , especially his Back-to-Basics Weekend Reading series. Check it out when you have the time. A section of this blog will be based on that idea. At least once every two weeks, I will pick one of the seminal published research papers that has had a high impact in the area of (distributed systems|computer networking|operating systems|storage), and will publish a writeup based upon my understanding. My background: I work as a software engineer in Silicon Valley working on a cloud-computing product.","tags":"pages","loc":"http://networkedsystems.in/pages/about.html","title":"About"}]}
